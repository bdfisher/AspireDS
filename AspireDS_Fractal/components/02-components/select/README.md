### Usage Guidelines

- Use when you have 5 or more options, otherwise use radio buttons if you have the space
- Use a consistent size of form components on the same page (i.e. using same width/height of a text input)
- Donâ€™t overwhelm the user with too many options
- Keep options to a single line of text
